A general space for writing about things in the lab. Will likely be messy.

### 24/1/22
- Made vesicle sample to get back into it after the new year. Forgot to check which side of ITO conductive so dessicated the wrong side for an hour; decided the sample was not a particularly important one anyway and so smeared the other side and kept going. Convenient as only suitable confocal time is this afternoon and I want to go over it with Guil again.
- Have booked confocal 15:00-17:00, will make some notes on key things to do/look out for, hoping for good fluorescence but not necessarily getting data today (also need to check vesicle floppiness - get this from Guil's notes when we did this before)
- Ideally need to get some DLW time early this week to have a working prototype lab-on-a-chip for friday
