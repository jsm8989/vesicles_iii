### Marking and lab books
- research skills (37.5)
- Scientific content (25)
- Communication skills - report (18.75)
  - Word limit, conciseness, citations etc. Remember real papers (summarising more work) are likely to be shorter.
- Communication - viva (18.75). 
  - Lab book relevant for assessor here. Likely end of may/start of June. 10-15 min introductory presentation. 
  - 

Lab book shows: 
- project planning, how you overcame problems, 
- date each entry - more like a diary than a full lab book
- aims and objectives for the day; problems; reflections; [more here]
- can be useful if students patent something! Eg new ideas discussed. 



### Planning and good research practice
- key outcomes, experiments, simulations? Will require a literature review
- milestones
- plan with timeline
- If you need building from the workshop get it in now**** (they do give priority to ptIII)
- Can use eg Gantt chart

- analyse the data as you go along
- have an idea of measurement errors and test results with known ones
- 


### Planning the write up
- Cull stuff that isn't interesting (in the interest of the word limit - can use appendices which don't contribute)


### Scientific writing style



### Citation and referencing
- They will put it through Turnitin if suspicious of plagiarism
-
