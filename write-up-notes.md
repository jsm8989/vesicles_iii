From C Smith lecture 25/1. HAND IN DEADLINE 16:00 16TH MAY 2022.


### Marking and lab books
- research skills (37.5)
- Scientific content (25)
- Communication skills - report (18.75)
  - Word limit, conciseness, citations etc. Remember real papers (summarising more work) are likely to be shorter.
- Communication - viva (18.75). 
  - Lab book relevant for assessor here. Likely end of may/start of June. 10-15 min introductory presentation. 

Lab book shows: 
- project planning, how you overcame problems, 
- date each entry - more like a diary than a full lab book
- aims and objectives for the day; problems; reflections; [more here]
- can be useful if students patent something, eg new ideas discussed. 



### Planning and good research practice
- key outcomes, experiments, simulations? Will require a literature review
- milestones
- plan with timeline
- If you need building from the workshop get it in now**** (they do give priority to ptIII)
- Can use eg Gantt chart

- analyse the data as you go along
- have an idea of measurement errors and test results with known ones
- don't throw away data


### Planning the write up
- Cull stuff that isn't interesting (in the interest of the word limit - can use appendices which don't contribute)
- Accumulate results
- Identify achievements and base chapter titles off these
- Estimate size requirement of each chapter (should be ~equal) and then write them

Suggested structure:
- Abstract, ToC, Intro, Lit review, Methods, Theory, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References ("a decent number"), Appendices (unlikely to be read in detail)
- Expect 20-30 pages excluding ref and appendices


### Scientific writing style
- dependent on preferences
- Eg sketch out everything and fill in the words
- or write the full chapter and re-edit into different headings with figures etc
- Easier to write more than cut stuff out!
- Every sentence should make a single point; emphasis at the end of the sentence/paragraph/chapter ("always leave on a polite note")
- Provide context before asking the reader to consider anything new
- Can use the active voice for stuff you've done so the assessor knows which bit was you
- It is not a novel
- Reduce details of things that didn't work or aren't relevant (unless they are interesting)
- Don't pad it up to 5000 for the sake of it (they are happy with a clear 3000 worder)


### Citation and referencing
- They will put it through Turnitin if suspicious of plagiarism
- Usual options for referencing (covered also in Keeping Lab Notes leaflet). Stick with one!
- Make it clear what is your own work; derivations and collaborations (including with other students) should be cited


### Remarks
- Go to Charles early if project problems
- If you are working with something patentable then need to submit an equal report without that as putting it through turnitin can count as publication and hence makes it unpatentable. Talk to Charles/Cambridge Enterprise for more about this. 
- Enjoy your taste of research!
