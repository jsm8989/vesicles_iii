See Roger's electroformation protocol for quantities

- Get vial, clean it in sonicator same as glass slides
- Literally just mix the things in the vial with the correct ratio. 
- NB the solvents are non-polar so prone to slip out of the pipette tip
- Also when using 3x pipette rounds for the chloroform, best to change tip between each draw as the solvent can affect the tip and therefore the volume taken up
