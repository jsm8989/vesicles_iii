From notes made during dry run with Guil, 24/1/22

See printed manual for details not included here. 

THE WORKING DISTANCE IS SMALLER THAN NIKON so image on something thin eg a coverslip (details of this likely in the paper*)

- allow resonant scanning when the software starts up - this fixes the scanning speed

Config tab
- select laser (we have been working with HeNe 633)
- select objective (have to select digitally and change manually until they agree). We have been using 63x1.40 OIL UV
- put oil on the obejctive!


acquire tab
- normally xyt scan
- can play around with mode, speed, format, pinhole (Airy is optimum and auto calculated), zoom factor
- theory for our paper assumes bidirectional x (may need to play with phase correction)
- don't do much with line/averaging features
- usually acquire a certain number of frames (standardise; enough to ensure they are uncorrelated)
- PMT vs HyD detectors have relative merits, but make sure the spectrum is nicely covered eitehr way (after choosing TX red DYE to see it)
- click visible
- can image using "live" or "start"
- will save from "experiments" tab as a lif
- dials in front are intuitive except for pinhole (don't use this one)
- process, quantify, display settings can be useful (but we didn't try them today). But most of the analysis can also be done on eg Fiji


NB: confocal contours are likely different to BF ones (why?)*
- Guil has a script which typically does series of frames in ImageJ
- Pietro might have a matlab one? (although it sounds as if Guil has most recent)
- for BF imaging on Temika need to switch out cameras - ask Guil or Jurij
