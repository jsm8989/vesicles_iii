Notes from Jurij meeting 1/11/21:
- Turn on
- Choose objectives etc
- Run temika
- Channel 1 = fluoro, channel 0 = BF
- Focus sample
- Close aperture diaphragm, filter diaphragm
- Move condenser until filter diagram is in focus, centre it
- Open it just outside field of view
- Play with illumination/camera/display settings
- Adjust aperture diaphragm as necessary
- Same for fluoro; just be sure to pick correct filter cube and check illumination settings again.
The above needs to be done every time (who knows what the previous set up was). Also be careful not to break the objective (ie touch the sample) - especially, eg, with the autofocus features. 

In general temika is very powerful!
