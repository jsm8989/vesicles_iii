##### Guide to the repo:
- Lab notes
- Tex files for collaborative write up (compiled pdfs when appropriate)
- Sample data
- Useful scripts (mostly python) for simulation, interfacing with temika, ImageJ(?), and extracting bending modulus from movie files

### TODO (23/2)
- (ALMOST DONE) Get flickering analysis to work for my data in user-friendly way
- Contribute to section 4.1 of Temika guide
- Modify Guil's simulation dynamics for RBCs
- Start writing report/paper outline
- DONE Collect/write up relevant protocols so I don't forget them (also eg confocal user guide)
- DONE Find good way of uploading handwritten notes to here

- Send Pietro images to check on the right track (when getting good ones - can check older stuff) (27/1)
- Get more comfortable with ImageJ
- DONE Speak to rutherford hub about claiming refunds (see Katie's last attempt a while ago) 
- DONE Write up temika/BF microscope usage protocol and things to look out for (see handwritten notes from initial meeting with Jurij)

- Add handwritten notes where appropriate, add more figures to lab notes
- Perhaps get the first contour of the movie file from python as this is currently the bottleneck
- make the `fit_results.txt` output of `analyze_all.py` much nicer to read!
