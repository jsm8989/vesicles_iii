##### Guide to the repo (eventually):
- Lab notes
- Tex files for collaborative write up (compiled pdfs when appropriate)
- Sample data
- Useful scripts (mostly python) for simulation, interfacing with temika, ImageJ(?), and extracting bending modulus from movie files
- NB all (most) data is in sf3/cicutagroup/jsm89, some will be in Z:/data_remote (it may need to pass through here on its way from temika)

### TODO (23/2)
- (ALMOST DONE) Get flickering analysis to work for my data in user-friendly way
- Contribute to section 4.1 of Temika guide
- Modify Guil's simulation dynamics for RBCs
- DONE Start writing report/paper outline
- DONE Collect/write up relevant protocols so I don't forget them (also eg confocal user guide)
- DONE Find good way of uploading handwritten notes to here

- DONE Send Pietro images to check on the right track (when getting good ones - can check older stuff) (27/1)
- Get more comfortable with ImageJ
- DONE Speak to rutherford hub about claiming refunds (see Katie's last attempt a while ago) 
- DONE Write up temika/BF microscope usage protocol and things to look out for (see handwritten notes from initial meeting with Jurij)

- Add handwritten notes where appropriate, add more figures to lab notes
- Perhaps get the first contour of the movie file from python as this is currently the bottleneck
- DONE make the `fit_results.txt` output of `analyze_all.py` much nicer to read!
- DONE transfer data over from Aske's computer (in Documents/Data wipe)


- Analyse the data we have before trying to take new stuff
- Coming in early should really help getting the data easily enough (with a good sample)
- Continue writing
