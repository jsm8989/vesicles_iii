##### Guide to the repo:
- Lab notes in `lab_notes.md`
- `.xml` files are for interfacing with Temika microscope
- All data is in [\\sf3\cicutagroup\jsm89] on the BSS network; some of the analysis results is in [Z:\code] which is also where this repo is found (as well as containing many other git repos with the bulk of the contour detection and analysis code)
- /plugins contains ImageJ plugins for reading `.movie` files
- /protocols contains reference material for different lab techniques
- /images contains media which have been included in the lab notes
- /scripts contains helper python scripts
- /example_files contains sample data and their associated contours to run a sample analysis
- /oiffiles contains a few things related to reading Olympus images, but in the end weren't used much


#### TODO
- (ALMOST DONE) Get flickering analysis to work for my data in user-friendly way
- DONE Contribute to section 4.1 of Temika guide
- Modify Guil's simulation dynamics for RBCs
- DONE Start writing report/paper outline
- DONE Collect/write up relevant protocols so I don't forget them (also eg confocal user guide)
- DONE Find good way of uploading handwritten notes to here

- DONE Send Pietro images to check on the right track (when getting good ones - can check older stuff) (27/1)
- DONE Get more comfortable with ImageJ
- DONE Speak to rutherford hub about claiming refunds (see Katie's last attempt a while ago) 
- DONE Write up temika/BF microscope usage protocol and things to look out for (see handwritten notes from initial meeting with Jurij)

- DONE Add handwritten notes where appropriate, add more figures to lab notes
- DONE Perhaps get the first contour of the movie file from python as this is currently the bottleneck
- DONE make the `fit_results.txt` output of `analyze_all.py` much nicer to read!
- DONE transfer data over from Aske's computer (in Documents/Data wipe)


- Analyse the data we have before trying to take new stuff
- Coming in early should really help getting the data easily enough (with a good sample)
- Continue writing
