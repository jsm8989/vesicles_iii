##### Guide to the repo:
- Lab notes
- Tex files for collaborative write up (compiled pdfs when appropriate)
- Sample data
- Useful scripts (mostly python) for simulation, interfacing with temika, ImageJ(?), and extracting bending modulus from movie files

### TODO (24/1)
- Get flickering analysis to work for my data in user-friendly way
- Contribute to section 4.1 of Temika guide
- Modify Guil's simulation dynamics for RBCs
- Start writing report/paper outline
- Collect/write up relevant protocols so I don't forget them (also eg confocal user guide)
- Find good way of uploading handwritten notes to here

- Send Pietro images to check on the right track (when getting good ones - can check older stuff) (27/1)
- Get more comfortable with ImageJ
- Speak to rutherford hub about claiming refunds (see Katie's last attempt a while ago)
