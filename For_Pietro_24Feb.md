To show:

- lif images on ImageJ 
    - how to make less noisy?
    - haven't worked on analysing these yet
    - possibly wrong laser


- BF images (ImageJ plugin not working here) via, eg load.py or save_image.py
    - the old ones are more floppy but less high quality, the newer ones are less floppy
    - currently only single frames annoyingly

- plot_contour_example.py using Guil's sample data


- analyze_all.py which returns a text file of results once the movies and their associated contours are available

- lab notes and others on GH (should share this repo)
    - anything I should add?


Questions:
- simulation aspect
- plan for Olympus?
- how much should I fit exactly the prescription in the paper (eg 197/200 in 1:9 vs 20/22 in 1:21)
- what to look out for in "how many frames"
